### Project Goals ### 
<p>The goal for this project is to make people aware of the importance of strong female playable characters in video games, specifically about how Aloy, the playable female character from 'Horizon Zero Dawn', a video game launched in 2017, has changed the landscape for female playable characters forever, at least for the site owner.</p>

### Design Choices ###
---
When designing this website, I looked for the designs used bij Guerilla Games and added my personal touch. I wanted it to breath the look and feel of the [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/nl-nl/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) website, so it feels familiar for user who know the game and at the same time I wanted to try and entice other users to wanting to play the game themselves.

**Fonts**

I originally intended to use the fonts that Guerilla games used as well, but found out pretty quickly that those fonts where designed specifically for them. So I looked for fonts that had as strong as a resemblance to the original fonts as possible.
I picked [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=quick) for the headers and titels and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=ralewa) for text.

**Icons**

Icons used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in moderation and are self explanatory.

**Colours**

The colours that are used are mainly the colours that Horizon Zero Dawn uses. 

* For body text and some titles: Martinique #37343d;
* For some headers and titles: Cornflower Blue #5983ff;
* For body background: White #ffffff;
* For additional backgrounds: Desert Storm #eae8e5;

**Styling**

Styling (look and feel) are based on the styling Guerilla Games have used for the Horizon Zero Dawn website.

**Images and Backgrounds**

Images where taken from:

## Technologies ##

**Wireframing:**

For wireframing I used Pencil Prototyping (LINK). This produced some very basis mock ups, used to get an overall 'feel' for what would go where and how things would look on different screensizes.

Links to Desktop, Tablet and Phone wireframes can be found ![here](https://github.com/byIlsa/Aloy-from-outcast-to-heroin/tree/master/wireframes)

**Other Technologies:**

* Bootstrap 4 [link](https://getbootstrap.com/)
	* The project uses Bootstrap 4 for grids, buttons, forms.
* Google fonts [link](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * The project uses google fonts for additional fonts.
* Font Awesome [link](https://fontawesome.com/)
	* The project uses Font Awesome for icons.

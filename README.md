### Design Choices ###
---
When designing this website, I looked for the designs used bij Guerilla Games and added my personal touch. I wanted it to breath the look and feel of the [Horizon Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/nl-nl/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) website, so it feels familiar for user who know the game and at the same time I wanted to try and entice other users to wanting to play the game themselves.

**Fonts**

I originally intended to use the fonts that Guerilla games used as well, but found out pretty quickly that those fonts where designed specifically for them. So I looked for fonts that had as strong as a resemblance to the original fonts as possible.
I picked [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=quick) for the headers and titels and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?category=Sans+Serif&preview.text=&preview.text_type=custom&query=ralewa) for text.

**Icons**

Icons used where provided by [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), used in moderation and are self explanatory.

**Colours**

The colours that are used are mainly the colours that Horizon Zero Dawn uses. 

* For body text and some titles: Martinique #37343d;
* For some headers and titles: Cornflower Blue #5983ff;
* For body background: White #ffffff;
* For additional backgrounds: Desert Storm #eae8e5;

**Styling**

Styling (look and feel) are based on the styling Guerilla Games have used for the Horizon Zero Dawn website.

**Images and Backgrounds**

Images where taken from:

## Technologies ##

**Wireframing:**

For wireframing I used Pencil Prototyping (LINK). This produced some very basis mock ups, used to get an overall 'feel' for what would go where and how things would look on different screensizes.

<p>View my wireframes <a href="https://github.com/byIlsa/Aloy-from-outcast-to-heroin/tree/master/wireframes">here.</a></p>

**Other Technologies:**

* Bootstrap 4 [link](https://getbootstrap.com/)
	* The project uses Bootstrap 4 for grids, buttons, forms.
* Google fonts [link](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * The project uses google fonts for additional fonts.
* Font Awesome [link](https://fontawesome.com/)
	* The project uses Font Awesome for icons.

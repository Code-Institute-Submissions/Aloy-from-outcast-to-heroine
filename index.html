                    <p>
                    A Nora Brave, Seeker and machine hunter of unparalleled skill, Aloy
                    is the genetic clone of 21st century roboticist and engineer Dr.
                    Elisabet Sobeck. She was created by GAIA, the governing artificial
                    intelligence of Zero Dawn, a global terraforming system that Sobeck
                    had designed and whose implementation she had spearheaded, which
                    restored life to Earth after its eradication by the Faro Plague.
                    GAIA created Aloy for the purpose of stopping HADES, a rogue AI bent
                    on reactivating the Faro Plague in order to wipe out life again.
                    Aloy succeeded, saving life on Earth and the humans of the new world
                    that Zero Dawn created. In doing so, she unraveled the mysteries of
                    why the world became as it is, and also learned the true nature of
                    her origins.

                <p class="aloy-section-text">
                Aloy was cast out from the Nora tribe at birth and raised by an
                outcast named Rost. As a child, she obtained a Focus, a small
                augmented reality device that gives her special perceptive
                abilities. After coming of age, Aloy enters a competition called
                the Proving to win the right to become a Nora Brave, and by
                extension, a member of the Nora tribe. Aloy wins the competition,
                but the Nora are attacked by cultists. Aloy is almost killed by
                their leader, Helis, but is saved by Rost, who sacrifices himself
                to save her. When Aloy awakes, a Matriarch explains that the
                cultists had gained control of corrupted machines. Aloy learns
                that as an infant, she was found at the foot of a sealed door.
                Oseram foreigner Olin informs Aloy that the cultists are part of a
                group called the Eclipse, and indicates that Aloy was targeted due
                to her resemblance to an Old World scientist named Dr. Elisabet
                Sobeck. Aloy locates the remnants of the company Faro Automated
                Solutions and discovers that the old world was destroyed nearly
                1,000 years ago after Faro lost control of its automated
                "peacekeeper" military robots. The robots, which could
                self-replicate and consumed biomass as fuel, overran the planet
                and consumed the biosphere, stripping Earth of all life. Project
                Zero Dawn, a top secret project spearheaded by Dr. Sobeck, was a
                plan to create an automated terraforming system to eventually shut
                the robots down and restore life to Earth.

            Kamuicosplay: "The moment I saw the trailer of Horizon Zero Dawn during the Sony
            Conference at E3 2015 I fell in love with Aloy. I had no idea who she
            was, why she was fighting robot dinosaurs but just based on the
            overall design I really felt the urge to cosplay her. However I
            someone who prefers to wait for a game, see if it’s good and then
            create a costume eventually afterwards. Now two years later, the game
            is here and it’s everything I hoped for! Aloy turned out to be one of
            the strongest, coolest and most badass characters and every single
            armor and weapon design is the game is simply amazing. My personal
            favorite was the Shadow Stalwart Heavy set which you obtain pretty
            late in the main story. The armor consists out of hundred individual
            armor plates, which seamed to be sewn on several layers of leather. At
            this point I had no idea how to build the costume or even which
            material I would have to choose, but we accepted the challenge!"

            There are some really cool fan art projects of Aloy and Horizon Zero Dawn

            and persistance of the artists, to bring to life, their rendition of 
            the character Aloy.
            From seeing the level of details, one can only conclude that Aloy
            is alive in the minds of many people and there is a strong emotional
            bond with this charater.

            The importance of strong, female playable character
            </h1>
            <p>
            There have been a lot of controversies lately about the lack of playable female characters in popular game franchises.
            Ubisoft recently got taken to task when it was revealed that Assassin's Creed: Unity and Far Cry 4, two of their flagship titles,
            both lacked playable female protagonists. Rockstar was likewise criticized in 2013 for having three playable male characters,
            yet no playable female characters, in Grand Theft Auto V.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            <strong>
            There are over six times as many games about a sole male protagonist as there are about a sole female protagonist.
            In other words, for every Lara Croft, there are about six male leads.</strong

            <h3>History of protagonists</h3>
            
            <p class="aloy-section-text">
                One of the flashpoints of GamerGate was Anita Sarkeesian's Tropes vs. Women in Videogames webseries,
                which began by blasting Princess Peach for existing solely to be rescued by Super Mario. 
                That '80s-era thinking has hardly gone away. Studies have found only a fraction of playable characters are female — Rockstar Games,
                for instance, couldn't find a room for a female even in GTAV, which had three separate playable leads — and only four percent of games are female-only. 
                The risk-averse industry theory is that female playable characters hurt profits, either by decreasing sales (because bros won't play as chicks) or increasing dev costs. 
                The latter argument was trotted out at E3 when Ubisoft admitted Assassin's Creed: Unity wouldn't have a female playable character in co-op because, said one developer, 
                "it was really a lot of extra production work." Another dismissed it as "a reality of game development."
